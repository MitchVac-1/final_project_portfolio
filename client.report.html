  <h1>Project Experience Report</h1>

  <h2>Client Report</h2>
  <div class="question">How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Since I love fireworks and always have, it was easy for me to find content and images from some personal shows that I have done in the past.
  </div>

  <div class="question">How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    To communicate with my developer I communicated through email and the only issues were myself communicated as I was not that good of a client.
  </div>

  <div class="question">Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Yes, Jake did a great job and it turned out great.
  </div>

  <div class="question">What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    I would defiently be a better client and provide a better wireframe/site plan just to be more useful.
  </div>

  <h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>
  <div class="question">How did you manage your development team and communicate the tasks for your junior devs?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    To manage the teams I set up seperate development team emails and we communicated through that email strand on the things the client specifically wanted.
  </div>

  <div class="question">How did you communicate with your client? Was there any issues?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    I communicated with my new client through email, and I had 0 issues communicating with him.
  </div>

  <div class="question">How did you handle publishing your clientâ€™s site and sharing it with the client?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    I published it onto github and sent him the link asking for suggestions and comments on what could be improved and made differently.
  </div>

  <div class="question">How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    I had a rough time with github, I had trouble getting all the links to work and upload. None of my stuff was saving correctly and it was all just a big mess. Overall I learned a lot more using github but I am still having toruble with it.
  </div>

  <h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>
  <div class="question">How did you communicate with your team lead? Was there any issues?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    We just communicated through email and it was limited but I think we got the job done. There was some lack of feedback but I got my work done.
  </div>

  <div class="question">Did you know what was expected of you for each site?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    For the most part, yes. Some siteplans were very poorly done/there was nothing there to work on.
  </div>

  <div class="question">Were you able to contribute to your sites?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Yes, I was able to complete the pages that I needed to do and contrubute effectively.
  </div>

  <div class="question">Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the sites?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    YES YES YES, on both of the Github sites I had many changes and ended up just emailing both the lead developers what I was supposed to do.
  </div>

  <h2>General Experience and Reflections</h2>
  <div class="question">What was the most challenging part of this project for you? Were you able to overcome it?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    The most challenging part was GitHub. I tried and tried to get it to work with me and finally i got it to work. I should have just gone to the help center but pride got in the way.
  </div>

  <div class="question">What did you enjoy most about this project?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    I liked the communication aspect of it all. I really enjoyed talking to people and seeing what changes needed to be done in order for it all to be fixed.
  </div>

  <div class="question">What would you do differently if you could do the project again?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    I would be a better client and junior developer. As a client I would defiently have created better plans and as a junior developer start earlier on my work instead of waiting a little bit.
  </div>

  <div class="question">Do you feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this experience? Explain.</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Yes! I really enjoyed working on real-world projects and feel much more confident after this experience as I was able to talk and learn new things with them.
